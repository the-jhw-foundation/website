	The Third Annual Oyster Roast was held at Deep Run Hunt Club on November 28, 2014.  The event was our largest event to date. While the event was a big success, our family and friends will be forever impacted by losing a dear friend, Brendan Worst, the following week. Brendan was a close friend of Henry's and almost everyone who attended the Oyster Roast.  He was a big supporter of The JHW Foundation.

	Brendan and Henry. Long may you run! We love you and miss you!!

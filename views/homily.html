			Human lives are lived on an edge where clashes darkness and light.  There is no life without pain and struggle, and there is no life without tenderness, depth, and rejoicing.  We all know that there is each.
			</p>
 			<p>
			Henry knew the clash, the struggle, intensely.  He was caught in a disease of addiction that is quite frankly horrid.It is horrid because it is a disease that separates you from others.  It can make you feel as though you have let down those you care about the most.  It can make you feel ashamed of yourself.  It can make you feel unwanted and judged unworthy. It is a horrid disease because it easily creates feelings of failure in the most intimate circles around the addicted, and it tempts them to blame themselves and/or another. It is a horrid disease because it creates an ethos of sympathy but also a silent, hushed distance in the community around the addicted, and when we around them are at our worst, we present ourselves as judgmental, disapproving, and condescending. It is horrid because it is a disease that its holder, and his loved ones know, that the picture of what a “normal life” is, will not be.  It is horrid because it takes such energy, such determination, such continual and constant vigilance, that if you suddenly have to face a huge set-back, such as Henry did with the unexpected death of his beloved grandmother, the fall can be dramatic, otherwise it is like the rock of Sisyphus, the task of recovery has to start all over again. It is a horrid disease because it strikes so seductively, and begins certainly with a variety of reasons, motives, and situations -  but perhaps central to them all is that it latches on to what each and all of us feel as human beings: a deep, deep restlessness, a hunger for something that we really don’t know what will satisfy.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			That restlessness is in each of us.  That restlessness of the soul is the field of danger, because it is there that powers of life and death clash if we do not recognize it for what it is: the hunger is for the fullness of Life. I want to make sure you hear this:  there – where our struggle, our pain, our fear, our loneliness rises up - is the very entrance into the land of light and joy, here, now, eternally.  What we of the church seek to announce to the world is that this is the hunger for the holy. It is satisfied only as we grow in surrender of our very self – all of our self -  into the Life-Loving arms of mercy love God reveals in Jesus of Nazareth.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Healing of any and all of our diseases and distresses comes from through opening our souls to the embrace of God, and receiving, surrendering into that compassion, that Life that fills our life, both here and beyond the gates of death.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Even now as we are in the midst of shock and grief at losing a child, a son, a brother, a grandson, a friend, we can begin to see a Way forward.  One piece of moving forward is to ask: what can we do fight this disease?  What can we do to put all the resources we have, just as motivated in our fight as any and all who fight cancer and other dreadful diseases, to confront this enemy and assist in beating it back, and back, and back day after day after day?
 			</p>
 			<p>
			There are many among us here with guidance.  This church, as do many, houses AA and Al-Anon.  As well there are those here of recovery institutions; there are people right here know to be effective, who have insight and guidance.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Another way to fight this disease is to acknowledge that our affluence and our rapture with induced excitement are our contribution to the problem.  To fight this disease, we are to name this disease of addiction in our midst, and fight through temptations of shrinking back into denial, fear of shame, or sense of failure.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			The list here could continue, but my understanding is theological, and that will conclude my remarks.  There is a Way, as Jesus called it.  He also warned it is narrow.  It is opened  as we pray, as we worship, as we attend to the love that God has for us.  This is the Way of surrendering each and every day to God, of somehow pausing to behold God’s kingdom of light and joy, communion and fellowship, where vulnerability is strength, where community is healing, where love is eternal.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			In that place, in this place, we realize that God’s Kingdom has much more to do with right relationships of acceptance and support than with being right.  It has much more with being connected than with being personally correct.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Being in that place, in this place does more than simply satisfy our personal, individual hunger, but it creates within us and among a community of the Kingdom where we know:
 			</p>
 			<p>
			The reign of God is not about a world without pain or mystery but simply a world where we would be in good contact with all things, where we would be connected and in communion with what (the poet) Mary Oliver calls “the daily presentations (of Love).”  Then all the world is our temple and church, and each person we encounter is a loved one. (adapted from Richard Rohr, Daily Meditations, Sept. 21, 2010.)
 			</p>
 			<p>
 			In this Way, by this inspiration of Love, we are invited to move forward.  In this Way, we are called together to be community, beholding God in one another, and loving one another.  First we are to surround this family, and these friends, in the days and nights ahead with that Love; then we can recognize that each day we can be inspired to be this way with each and all we encounter. This is life, with God, this is “Gloryland,” in the big, full, and final picture – and we can do it now."

	<h2>John Watkins</h2>
	<p>John Watkins fought to help his beloved son free himself from the pain and struggle of addiction, and felt the helplessness many families of addicts experience when Henry finally succumbed to an accidental overdose. John says of Henry, "He excelled in everything he put his mind to and he was always determined to win. However, he was not able to beat the addiction that took total control over him.  Losing Henry was devastating to our family. I hope to inform others that addiction is a disease, not a behavioral problem. I am honored to be a part of a foundation that helps young adults who suffer from addiction and offers support to those in a time where others may have turned their backs to them."</p>
	
	<h2>Rosalind Watkins</h2>
	<p>As Henry's stepmother, Rosalind Watkins knows very well the sorrow and powerlessness family members feel when a loved one struggles with addiction. But through her work with the foundation, Roz has also seen the many successes young adults can have when given the right support system and environment in which to battle addiction. Because the college years are such a difficult place to maintain sobriety, Roz is particularly drawn to the foundation's work with College Recovery Communities, which provides young adults in a college setting with the support they need to stay sober.</p>
	
	<h2>Lee Lee Watkins</h2>
	<p>Lee Lee Watkins lost her beloved older brother and best friend to addiction and believes that if the foundation can help prevent just one family from suffering this ultimate loss, then they will have succeeded. Henry and Lee Lee spent their childhoods like many brothers and sisters: laughing, playing, watching movies and just having fun together. Henry's heart of gold and contagious smile made him an endearing older brother who was always protective of his little sister and looked out for her best interests in every situation. Says Lee Lee, "I now have a lifelong empathy for any family suffering from the weight of addiction and a hard-earned knowledge of how cunning the disease can be. Henry was a light in our family, and he was taken from us far too soon. He would want us to advocate for others who suffer as he did, and help those who feel terribly alone."</p>
	
	<h2>Kevin Meyer</h2>
	<p>A graduate of the University of Michigan and the founder of the JHW Foundation, Kevin Meyer met Henry Watkins on the first day of kindergarten at the St. Christopher School and they remained fast friends throughout grade school, high school and college. As Henry slowly became a victim of addiction, Kevin did all he could to support and help his dear friend, and learned firsthand the complex range of emotions and issues that families and friends of addicts endure as their loved ones cope with this deadly disease. After Henry's overdose, Kevin started the JHW Foundation as a way of to honor Henry and to help others who are suffering as Henry did.</p>
	
	<h2>Chas Skidmore</h2>
	<p>Chas Skidmore’s very first trip to the principal’s office occurred in 4th grade when Henry caused him to laugh so hard in reading that he got in trouble for disturbing the class. Chas and Henry first became friends in kindergarten at St. Christopher’s School and remained best friends until Henry’s death. Chas recalls that Henry could always make a bad day better with his easygoing humor and ready smile. Says Chas, “I saw firsthand how addiction touches not only the individual involved, but everyone who comes in contact with the affected. I hope the foundation will spread Henry's voice to those who are in need.  Henry continues to shape my life every day, and he would want us to help those currently suffering who believe that "no one else understands."</p>
	
	<h2>Tom Bannard</h2>
	<p>Tom Bannard has first-hand experience in the struggles with addiction that many young people first encounter in the college environment.  While at the University of Virginia, Tom benefitted greatly from the "Hoos in Recovery" program and after graduation he became a Certified Alcohol Drug Counselor (CDAC) in order to help those who suffer from the disease of addiction. Currently the Shelter Operation Manager for CARITAS, Tom also shares his experiences and time with the young people involved in the "Rams in Recovery" program at VCU.  He finds much to be grateful for in the daily gift of recovery including wonderful and meaningful relationships with family and friends, as well as an incredibly rewarding career. Tom believes in striving to spread those gifts to others through his work with the JHW Foundation.</p>
	
	<h2>Lynda Hatcher</h2>
	<p>Lynda Hatcher watched helplessly as her son struggled with a substance abuse disorder that left him facing a lengthy jail term for a felony charge for distribution of a controlled substance. Lynda, who now writes a blog about her experiences at www.motheraddiction.com, has been pleased to see the focus for the loved ones of addicts change from a position of anonymity to one of advocacy. She hopes that the JHW Foundation will help not only the young adults who are fighting their battles with addiction, but also the families and friends of the afflicted, who have often suffered in silence while working to help their loved ones in their struggles.</p>		


	<h2>Bob Sangster</h2>
	<p>In 2007, Bob Sangster co-founded the FROG Houses that provide transitional recovery homes for men (and later a house for women) evolving from a treatment environment to sober independence.  The FROG Houses received the 2012 Program of Excellence Award by the Virginia Association of Drug and Alcohol Programs. Bob also founded Foundations of Recovery, a very small group intensive recovery program initially designed for medical professionals that has proven successful with many others. Bob received the Volunteer of The Year Award from The Healing Place in 2012. Bob's active volunteer spirit and extensive experience in the world of addiction recovery, as well as his background in public relations and business make him an asset to the JHW Foundation board, as well as to the recovery environment in Richmond.</p>

	<p>Beth is a life-long Richmonder who is married to Alex Skidmore. She has two sons, Alex and Chas. Chas and Henry were best buddies since second grade.
